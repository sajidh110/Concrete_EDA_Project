**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset of concrete mixtures to understand how different material components (like cement, water, aggregates, etc.) and age influence the compressive strength of concrete.

By analyzing the relationships and trends in the data, this project aims to generate useful insights for civil engineers, researchers, and construction professionals to improve mix design, optimize costs, and ensure durability and strength.
